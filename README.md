## Kiwik

This is a Twitter Clone that I made using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.

I am continuing to add onto this to improve the looks, adding features like the ability to "like" a "tweet".

## Instructions to run

To run this program, you must
run "npm install" in the main folder and also in the server folder

In the server folder,
Go to middleware.js and tweets.js and change the jwtsecret constant to be something of your choice. It is currently set to nothing, so you must add it for this site to work

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Which will run both the backend and frontend simultaneously
