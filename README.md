## Kiwik

This is a Twitter Clone that I made using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.

I am continuing to add onto this to improve the looks, adding features like the ability to "like" a "tweet".

## Instructions to run

To run this program, you must
run "npm install" in the main folder and also in the server folder

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Which will run both the backend and frontend simultaneously
